# recipe-app-api

Recipe API App built from scratch using Django. This project taught me how to Build a Backend REST API using Python, Django, Django REST Framework, Docker, Travis CI, and Postgres. 

The project was also completed using Test Driven Development throughout each stage. This highlighted to me the importance of creating, and maintaining clean code that can be easily tested, and used by others.
